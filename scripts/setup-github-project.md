# Shield AI MVP — Add Issues to GitHub Project

The Shield AI MVP flow has been created in the **shield_AI_project_management** repository:

- **11 User Stories** (Issues #1–11): US-0001 through US-0011
- **16 Tasks** (Issues #12–27): T-0001 through T-0016
- **All tasks linked** to their parent user stories as sub-issues
